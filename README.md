# BW-2-Fitness-ML
Repository created for the project in Build Week-2 at Epicode Global. The project will perform Transport Mode selection analysis based on the dataset developed by the University of Bologna.

The goal of the project is to create a machine learning with high accuracy to predict the mode of transportation in order to use it in fitness watch. 

We have used the following dataset: https://tempesta.cs.unibo.it/projects/us-tm2017/download.html by Carpineti C., Lomonaco V., Bedogni L., Di Felice M., Bononi L., "Custom Dual Transportation Mode Detection by Smartphone Devices Exploiting Sensor Diversity", in Proceedings of the 14th Workshop on Context and Activity Modeling and Recognition (IEEE COMOREA 2018), Athens, Greece, March 19-23, 2018.
